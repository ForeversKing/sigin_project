24 Dec 2019 11:44:19 tensorflow WARNING  From /home/yulongwu/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py:263: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
24 Dec 2019 11:44:20 tensorflow WARNING  From /tmp/de_modules/lib/networks/network.py:99: LSTMCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
24 Dec 2019 11:44:20 tensorflow WARNING  From /tmp/de_modules/lib/networks/network.py:102: bidirectional_dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.RNN(cell))`, which is equivalent to this API
24 Dec 2019 11:44:20 tensorflow WARNING  From /home/yulongwu/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py:443: dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell)`, which is equivalent to this API
24 Dec 2019 11:44:20 tensorflow WARNING  From /tmp/de_modules/lib/networks/network.py:237: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, use
    tf.py_function, which takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    
24 Dec 2019 11:44:21 tensorflow WARNING  From /home/yulongwu/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py:3066: to_int32 (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
